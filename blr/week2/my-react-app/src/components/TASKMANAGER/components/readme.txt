This is a simple and interactive task management app built with **React**. It lets you add, edit, delete, complete, and filter tasks.
Features

- Add new tasks with input validation
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Edit tasks inline
- Delete tasks with confirmation
- Filter by All / Completed / Pending
- See task statistics (total and completed)

How do components talk to each other?
Child â†’ Parent communication uses callback props.
TaskForm calls onAdd to pass new tasks up.
TaskItem calls onEdit, onDelete, onToggle via props.

Data flow example:
User types a task in TaskForm and clicks "Add".
TaskForm runs onAdd(taskText).
TaskManager adds it to tasks state.
TaskList receives updated tasks as a prop.
TaskItem renders the task.
